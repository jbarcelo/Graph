------------------------------   
Looking for neighbors at distance: 1   
Looking for neighbors of node 0  
Node 1 is adjacent  
Node 1 is not in our list. We add it.  
At this point we should verify if the new node satisfied the search condition.  
Node 2 is adjacent  
Node 2 is not in our list. We add it.  
At this point we should verify if the new node satisfied the search condition.  
newNeighbors found: 2  
------------------------------  
Looking for neighbors at distance: 2  
Looking for neighbors of node 1  
Node 0 is adjacent  
Node 3 is adjacent  
Node 3 is not in our list. We add it.  
At this point we should verify if the new node satisfied the search condition.  
Looking for neighbors of node 2  
Node 0 is adjacent

------------------------------  
Looking for neighbors at distance: 3  
Looking for neighbors of node 3  
Node 1 is adjacent  
Node 2 is adjacent  
Node 4 is adjacent  
Node 4 is not in our list. We add it.  
At this point we should verify if the new node satisfied the search condition.
